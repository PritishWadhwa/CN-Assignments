The problem spotted here is the Count to infinity problem.
Here the values between a and b are being updated by the count of 1 as they both advertise a cheaper path, to C, each other.
Due to this the values increment by the factor of 1 only and when it reaches the threshold value(here 16), it gets to know to original cost.
Since we are considering infinity as 16 here, the values get stuck once they reach infinity(here 16).
This can be solved by implementing poisoned reverse algorithm.
